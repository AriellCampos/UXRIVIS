Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized. <br><br>There are many benefits to using Classroom:<br>• Easy to set up – Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.<br>• Saves time – The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.<br>• Improves organization – Students can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.<br>• Enhances communication – Classroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream",

I don’t want to have to refresh each class in order for me to see new posts! I’ve already uninstalled and re-downloaded the app. And i have checked notification is turned on in my setting 😎",
